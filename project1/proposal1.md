# Opioid Abuse and Access to Medical Care

#### Filipe F. Borba and Micah H. Reid

We have both the GSS dataset and the NSDUH dataset in hand. The full GSS dataset can be easily downloaded from the website, but we need to compile the NSDUH dataset for each year. Even though we have this overhead, it is not hard to get the data that we want.

Both the GSS and NSDUH datasets terms and conditions say that we need to credit them for providing the dataset and we canâ€™t try to identify any of the people surveyed. We should only use them for research or statistical purposes.

The NSDUH has data on usage of various opioids, health insurance, and income, but the data is categorical rather than presenting raw values. The GSS has some data with raw values (like income), but has fewer relevant survey questions.

The largest ethical concern would be misrepresenting a population in an unflattering light, which in a worst case scenario could influence public opinion and policy in an unfair and misleading way. Due to the large dataset and number of respondents in each group, there is less concern about anonymity of individual users, especially given that the raw data is already available to the public.

We hope to investigate nuances in the reasons behind the opioid epidemic, mostly related to healthcare access. We would like to specifically investigate the links between prescribed painkillers leading to opioid abuse, and who gets prescribed painkillers in the first place. A major focus will be health insurance and income, to see if these factors related to access to medical care show interesting correlations with opioid abuse.

This could also be compared to type of opioid abuse (misuse of prescription drugs versus heroin use). There is also interesting data on where drugs are obtained, use of rehabilitation services, and mental health treatment and diagnose, which could all be compared along economic class factors.
