## How does health insurance affect rates of use and abuse of opioids?
Over the course of this project, we investigated the differences in use and abuse of opioids for those with private health insurance, Medicaid, and no insurance. The goal was to identify generalized weak points in the American healthcare system that could be investigated to decrease opioid dependency. We recognize that health insurance type is often a proxy for income and social class, and we do not claim that health insurance is the only variable contributing to our results. However, we hope that this project will start a conversation about quality and access of care.


## Methodology
For this project we used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the year 2017. We investigated variables related to prescription painkiller use and misuse, compared against the categorical variable of health insurance type. This project does not account for trends over time, and is only meant to reflect recent history.

When comparing data, we normalized the population sizes so as not to have an outsized effect from those who have private health insurance, which was a substantially larger population group in our data set.

We compared through cross tabulations recency of prescription painkiller use and misuse over groupings based on health insurance. We also explored combined groupings with health insurance, using the variable of having ever used prescription painkillers.

## Results
We found that across the board, those with private health insurance both used and abused prescription painkillers in significantly smaller percentages. Those with Medicaid used painkillers at a higher rate, but those without insurance at all abused painkillers at a higher rate. We also included a variable for other types of health insurance which were not sorted, and this accounted for the highest painkiller use at all. Because this grouping is not intentionally defined, it will be mostly excluded from analysis, but it should be investigated further at a later time.

While there were clear trends in misuse, the total percentage of people who had misused painkillers was low, even controlling for those who had used painkillers at some point in their life. We decided to also investigate continued use of painkillers. While the data did not include first usages or time period of usage, we were able to compare recency between the groups. We found that of those who had ever used prescription painkillers, those with Medicaid had a 71% probability of having used painkillers in the past year, compared to 50% and 59% for private or no health insurance, respectively. This is a strong indicator that those with Medicaid are staying on painkillers for significantly longer time periods.

## Analysis
There were strong trends indicating increased use of painkillers in populations without private health insurance. An obvious conclusion would be that those without private health insurance only have access to lower quality care. We could make the leap that lower quality care leads to catch-all solutions like painkillers, rather than focused treatments.

This may or not be true, but it is important to recognize the other variables at play. One variable not accounted for in this report is disability. Those with disabilities earn 37% less on average (American Psychological Association), which could imply that they are more likely to rely on social benefits or go without insurance. It seems logical that there would be a link between disability and pain, so the increased duration and frequency painkiller use could partially or fully be due to more legitimate reasons related to medical conditions.

There are many more factors that we can only speculate about, so further research must be done to pinpoint the reason for this increase. Lower quality healthcare could very well be a cause, but more variables need to be isolated before that conclusion is drawn. There is a lack of detailed data around healthcare type, prescription frequencies, and prescription reasons, so a separate study with independent data collection is likely the best way to continue investigation.
